# SwipeFresh

## Inspiration
SwipeFresh was created with passion for simplifying meal choices and discovering exciting flavors. Our app is designed to turn the often daunting task of meal selection that suits one's taste into an enjoyable experience. The interactive design, similar to a game, aims to make exploring new culinary delights as delightful as the meals themselves.

##What it does
SwipeFresh is a one-of-a-kind application that introduces users to a novel way of discovering exciting recipes through a swiping interface, reminiscent of popular apps like Tinder or Bumble. Users can effortlessly swipe right to express their interest in a recipe or left to seamlessly move on to the next one. The app employs a filtering recommendation algorithm to tailor recipe suggestions based on each user's swiping behavior and feedback. The liked recipes can be viewed later in a list.

##How we built it
Built with swiftUI, SwipeFresh delivers a seamless and responsive user interface. Our custom-built AI-driven recommendation algorithms analyze user interactions to provide personalized and engaging recipe suggestions.

##Challenges we ran into
Developing SwipeFresh posed challenges, particularly in refining the recommendation algorithm to ensure accuracy and relevance. Another challenge was to integrate the swipe functionality and achieve a smooth, intuitive and visually applealing user interface.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in successfully implementing a novel way for users to interact with and discover recipes through SwipeFresh. Our recommendation algorithm showcases the potential of personalized content delivery and a intuitive user interface.

##What we learned
As a team, we enhanced our collaboration and problem-solving skills throughout the project.

##What's next for SwipeFresh
Extending the custom recommendation algorithm by adapting and further testing it is the first step on our list. Additionally, adding more statistical information and achievements based on it would provide an even better user experience.
